Hi!

This is your home assignment :) 

The task is based on a real world project. You're helping a metalworking company that sells different types of metal goods. The company receives orders from customers and the orders are usually formatted as emails. For example it could be something like: "Hello, we would like to order 20 pipes with a diameter of 108 mm and a length of 6 meters.". After that the order is being processed by the manager who finds the right items from the catalogue and creates the final order.

There're a lot of daily orders, so we would like to automate the ordering process. Luckily, LLMs exist!

At the first step of the project you don't have to worry about extracting the orders from emails. We've done it for you and the file queries.csv contains the user's input in quite structured and convenient format. The queries are cleaned and somewhat standardized, but of course, in the real world, customers do not always follow industry standards and often make errors and typos.

The catalogue file is catalog.csv. It's also far from perfect, but this is life :) 

Each catalog row (or ‚Äúdatabase entry‚Äù) contains a product name, dimensions, material, and modifiers (e.g., polishing). We strongly recommend entering a few rows into ChatGPT ‚Äî it will help explain what‚Äôs what and give you a better understanding of the data.
Each catalog entry contains a description ‚Äî this is the field you'll typically embed for similarity search.

Oh, and one more thing! The catalog and queries are in Spanish. But that just makes the challenge more interesting, right? :D 

So, let's finally discuss the task!

1) Main goal: Given each user's query, you should find the best matching ID ('sku') from the catalog and extract the quantity + unit (could be pieces, meters, kilograms, etc.). Don‚Äôt forget to calculate some metrics to evaluate the performance of your pipeline, and provide a final output file with your answers. It's enough to output query,sku,items_count,mass_units,length_units,length,mass.
2) Improvement idea: You can start with a simple vector search, but, probably, you might have some ideas on how to improve the relevance of the extracted items?
3) Bonus challenge: As mentioned earlier, queries.csv is already structured. But real-life emails are not. So let‚Äôs go one step further toward production:
    3.1) Take items from the catalog and generate (hint: use LLMs üòÑ) several user emails that order those items. Try generating emails with varying complexity.
    3.2) You can include one or multiple items per email ‚Äî that‚Äôs up to you.
    3.3) Then, use the generated emails as your input data and parse the orders from them.
    3.4) The output should match the format of the first task: matched SKU + quantity + units.

Files included:
1) catalog.csv: the database of all items you have and their sku.
2) queries.csv: contains users queries.
3) examples.csv: contains a couple of example inputs and outputs.
4) answers.csv: contains all correct answers for comparison.
5) test_homework.py: includes a few helper functions for working with the together.ai API, FAISS database, embedding models, etc. Feel free to use your own tools too!

As of now, together.ai gives $1 in free credits per registered email (you can create multiple accounts if needed). They also offer a free version of LLaMA-3.3-70B. Based on our experience, even $1‚Äì$2 is usually enough, even with larger models ‚Äî and the free one works fine too.

The code was tested on Python 3.11, but other versions should also work (depending on your OS).

PLEASE:
This task is based on a real-world example. While the data has been anonymized, please do not share or publish any of the datasets or the solutions. Thank you!

Good luck!
